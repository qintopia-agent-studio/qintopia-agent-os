# CI/CD Gates

CI/CD is the enforcement layer for the monorepo collaboration model. Production-facing
work moves through git, review, CI, deployment preflight, and a runbook. Server-side
edits and single-file `scp` overwrites are not normal release paths.

## Required Local Check

Run the full repository gate before opening or merging a PR:

```bash
pnpm check
```

The check currently includes:

- formatting and Markdown linting
- registry and manifest validation
- active Agent package validation
- anti-drift policy checks
- secret and runtime-state scanning
- CI-safe deployment preflight
- QiWe package tests
- sidecar Rust tests
- no-credential sidecar smoke checks

## Secret And Runtime-State Gate

`pnpm secrets:check` blocks committed live secrets and runtime artifacts. It scans
git-visible files and fails on real `.env` files, private keys, credential files,
runtime databases, logs, sessions, caches, request dumps, and high-confidence long
credential assignments.

Example files are allowed only when the values are clearly placeholders, fake values,
test values, or environment variable references.

## Deployment Preflight

`pnpm deploy:preflight:ci` is non-mutating and runs inside `pnpm check`. It verifies
that the repository still has the required deployment policy, cutover plan, package
scripts, and CI gate coverage.

`pnpm deploy:preflight` is the local pre-deploy gate. It additionally requires:

- current branch is `master`
- worktree is clean
- deployment docs and rollback notes are present

This command does not deploy and does not connect to the server. Actual deployment
belongs to a reviewed runbook using an approved commit SHA.

## GitHub Actions

The GitHub Actions CI workflow runs on pull requests and pushes to `master`. It installs
Node.js, pnpm, Python, and Rust, then runs `pnpm check`.

Required production-adjacent PR evidence:

- target package or runtime area
- commit SHA or branch under review
- validation command output
- external-send, database-write, runtime-profile, secret, Feishu, QiWe, systemd, and
  nginx impact
- smoke plan
- rollback plan
