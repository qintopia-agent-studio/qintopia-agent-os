## Core Rules

- Organize by Agent OS capability, not by programming language.
- Rust, Python, TypeScript, shell, and SQL are implementation details inside a package.
- Do not create top-level `python/`, `rust/`, `typescript/`, or similar language
  buckets.
- Do not develop directly on `master`; create a feature branch first.
- Document first for new features, behavior changes, migrations, runtime changes, or
  production-adjacent work.
- Use Conventional Commits for commit messages. Allowed types are `build`, `chore`,
  `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `revert`, `style`, and `test`.
- Do not manually edit root `CHANGELOG.md` in ordinary feature or fix PRs. Release
  Please owns routine release changelog updates from merged Conventional Commits.
- Merging a Release Please PR prepares a version and draft GitHub Release. Production
  deployment still requires the owner to manually publish that draft Release.
- Do not hand humans a prefilled GitHub compare URL as the normal PR flow. Use
  `pnpm pr:doctor`, then `pnpm pr:create` with a completed PR body. If GitHub CLI is
  missing, run `pnpm pr:bootstrap` and follow `gh auth login`.
- Do not introduce Java, Gradle, Maven, Kotlin, Go, Swift, C#, PHP, Ruby, Elixir, or a
  new language/toolchain stack without an explicit owner-approved architecture decision.
- Do not hot-edit production servers.
- Do not copy secrets, live `.env` files, tokens, table ids, private chat logs, raw
  member profiles, or server-only runtime state into git.
- WorkTool is not a Qintopia Agent OS channel for new work. Treat WorkTool and the
  WorkTool Hermes plugin as deprecated or audit-only material.
- Hermes Kanban is not the future task/orchestration backbone. Do not build new
  workflows on Hermes Kanban.
- Postgres/AgentOS is the system fact source. Feishu is a human workbench and mirror,
  not the source of truth.
- Hermes remains the Agent runtime. It should not become the business database.
- Xiaoman activity signal intake uses `xiaoman-activity signal-ingest` to create
  `xiaoman.create_activity_request` through the operations control plane with
  `requester_agent=default` and `target_agent=xiaoman`; do not bypass capability policy
  by making Xiaoman call its own provider capability directly.
- Xiaoman signal apply smokes should use sanitized non-UUID event signal ids unless a
  matching `qintopia_agent_os.event_signals` row is created first; UUID
  `event_signal_id` values are stored as `source_event_signal_id` and must satisfy the
  Postgres foreign key.

## Package Placement

- Agent profile, prompt, allowed skills, memory policy, and forbidden actions:
  `agents/<agent>/`.
- Reusable channel or business capability: `skills/<capability>/`.
- Cross-Agent business process: `workflows/<workflow>/`.
- MCP server or adapter: `mcp/<adapter>/`.
- Runtime template or render/check logic: `runtime/<runtime-area>/`.
- Release, smoke, rollback, or server install logic: `deploy/<area>/`.
- Historical POC or removed direction: `deprecated/<topic>/`.

## Package Contract

Every adopted package should eventually include:

- `README.md`
- `manifest.yaml`, `agent.yaml`, or `workflow.yaml`
- `tests/` or `fixtures/`
- owner and risk level
- validation command
- production boundary
- rollback or decommission notes when relevant

Do not migrate a package as production-ready until these are present or there is a
documented exception.

## Migration Rules

Migration is inventory-first:

1. Identify the current source path.
2. Record whether it is `adopt`, `template`, `runtime-only`, `deprecated`, or `remove`.
3. Preserve source hash or commit reference.
4. Add package metadata.
5. Add focused tests or fixtures.
6. Only then wire it into registry and deployment.

Server runtime directories under `.hermes/profiles/*` must be treated as live runtime
state. They can produce inventory records, templates, or diffs; they must not be copied
wholesale into this repository.

## Server Change Policy

The server is a deployment target, not an editing workspace.

Allowed server activity:

- read-only inventory
- service status checks
- log inspection
- smoke checks
- deploying an approved commit SHA through a runbook
- emergency rollback with a follow-up patch and owner record

Disallowed server activity:

- editing docs directly
- editing code directly
- editing `.hermes` runtime files directly
- scp overwrites of single source files
- committing unreviewed experiments on the server and treating them as product direction

## Validation Expectations

Before a PR:

- Run package-level tests.
- Run fixture replay when available.
- Run registry/manifest checks when available.
- Validate the completed PR body with `pnpm pr:check-body` or `pnpm pr:doctor`.
- For runtime/deploy changes, include dry-run output and rollback notes.
- For user-facing HTML reports, run HTML parse and browser overflow checks.
- For production-adjacent changes, state whether the change touches external sends,
  database writes, profile runtime, secrets, Feishu, QiWe, or systemd.

## Documentation Rules

- Keep decisions in git, not only in chat.
- Prefer short, focused docs over one large manual.
- Mark server-side exploration as unapproved until owner review confirms it.
- Avoid formalistic phrasing when writing internal engineering docs.
- Keep technical reports concrete: current state, evidence, risk, next action.
